# Losers-list

**Loser's list? What's this?**
<br>This is a list for Team Fortress 2 Bot Detector.
<br>It includes players who were found cheating, defending or associates with cheater.


**What are these additional tags you put in "proof" for players in this list?**
<br>-*Cheater*
<br>Straight forward, players who were witnessed cheating.
<br>-*Associate*
<br>This tag is for players who were found playing with cheaters.
<br>An example of an associate is a player who heals a cheater.
<br>-*Defender*
<br>This tag is for players who were defending a cheater during game and refuses to take actions against them (votekick them).
<br>And on top of this, they start speaking non-sense about they should be good because you pointed them out.

**Is there a way for my name to be removed?**
<br>LOL

**Are there any contributor to this list?**
<br>Yes, thanks to them.
